# Necrosmith Crafter

Keep tracking of your unlocked recipes.


## Description

Simple web app to keep track of your unlocked recipes of Necrosmith from Alawar (I like the game, recommended).

This project is free from javascript and css dependencies (yes, old school :older_man:). The check list is stored in localstorage.

Do not recommend frameworks, libreries or whatever. Send pull requests.


## You said "no dependencies" but you use python dependencies to scrap the data

:nerd_face:


## Features roadmap

I'm not planning to evolve this project, but here is a list of cool thinks that may be added (someday or never):

**Generate random recipe**

If someone wants to play a "random challenge" of building some specific dead, it will generate one (or more).


**Save custom recipes**

Why not.


**Necrosmith 2 recipes**

I have the game on steam, but not played yet.

Maybe I'll create a sepparated repo for that.


**Minify or compress the content**

No. Send pull request.
